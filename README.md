An implemtation of binaryNet for Keras.

The binarized Dense and Conv2D are two keras layers, thus can be integrated into keras framework out of box.

To run the demo:
python mnist_mlp.py # train a binary MLP model on MNIST
python mnist_cnn.py # train a binary CNN model on MNIST

The code is according to the [theano version](https://github.com/MatthieuCourbariaux/BinaryNet).
The only missing ingredient is that the learning rate is not scaled w.r.t. weight' fan-in & fan-out. 
(An involved [patch](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/3004) is needed.)
